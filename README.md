# cdsSeqFileHandler
Class for reading/writing text files. Hides channels, handles BOMs, embedded CRLF and embedded quotes.

Class first shown as part of UK DataFlex Meetup 4th March 2021.

The idea of the class was to make reading/writing to a text file akin to reading/writing from/to a database table. Examples can be found within the comments of the cdsSeqFileHandler.pkg file, but some small example .src files are also included in the workspace.
